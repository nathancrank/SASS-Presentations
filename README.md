# SASS
Â© 2012 Nathan Crank

These are the files for my presentations on SASS.
The presentation slides are available [on my Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BfJDSHUVhXmQ4YeDRH5cL_PbF5zMr6N07hGQLdB5XSQ/edit).

The master branch is the default starting point for each presentation.

Each other branch represents a unique presentation.

Feel free to reuse the presentation slides and demos. Please just give me due credit.
